# COC Diwali Single Page Application
### Made on React JS

## WISH YOU ALL A VERY HAPPY DIWALI

```
# To run the Repo on localhost
npm run start

# To build repo files
npm run build

# Deploys directly to github pages (Redundant)
npm run deploy
```


NOTE: In webpack.config.js, change mode to development for faster changes in code,
and change mode to production to build minified and optimized JS code

(P.S. Deployment is a pain in the butt, period. -_-)
